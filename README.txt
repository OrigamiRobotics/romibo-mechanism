This folder contains the CAD (Computer Aided Design) models for the Romibo (R)
robot Revision 2 design.  These design files were created by Garth Zeglin using
the commercial CAD program SolidWorks 2010 Standard.  They can be viewed using
the free eDrawings Viewer available from Dassault Syst√®mes SolidWorks Corp. at
http://www.edrawingsviewer.com/.

The model primarily includes the flat snap-fit plastic parts of the robot
structure.  These are suitable for laser-cutting from flat double-smooth ABS
plastic of nominal 1/8" thickness.  This material has an actual thickness of
about 0.118 inches, reflected in the slot widths in the structure.

respective open source terms.
